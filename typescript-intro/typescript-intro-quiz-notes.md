## Notes

A function is defined named add that is receiving 2 parameters x & y.
: number was added after each of the parameter names to indicate that both of them must be passed number values when called.
: number is added after the parameter list. This syntax indicates the data type the function will return.
number is used here because the function is returning the sum of two numbers, which is a number value.
